            <p>This talented dinosaur will surprise you with sudden outbursts of beastly noise and a sexy performance of Single Ladies (by Beyonce). She is the best entertainer that JSA has ever seen (in so many ways).

            <p>"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but balls and rackets excite me!" AKA Mierkat, this creature can ace any match that faces him, whether it be pole dancing with JR or Wii Mario Kart with his roomies. When he is not busy hitting balls, he is usually found blogging about his experiences as a Whartonite or doing the creep around campus.

            <p>If you have an inexplicable fear for your food's safety, chances are you are in close proximity to our fearless leader. While Reina-deer may not have a bright and shiny nose, she can usually be found munching on bananas and sipping tea.

  	  			<p>Ryun used to be called the JSA baby. He has really come a long way, for now he is the president. This sweetheart has carved his niche as the charismatic leader who will melt your heart with his romantic singing and suck your soul with his camera.

One moment, she's the homey one that peels shrimp faster than everyone else; in another, she'll be out dancing about in her sexy, sparkly dresses. Now she has returned from a semester in France as the classy madam of JSA!

            <p>Do you hear that sick techno song? It's probably playing from Yusuke's headphones. This boy is not only a hardcore raver, but a hardworking biology major (maybe a little too hardworking when he fails to wake up on time after "attempting" to pull an all-nighter). Although a bit MIA at times, he can usually be found rocking his shades around campus or playing tracks on the WQHS radio station if he's not flooding his own FB wall with music.

				ANY problem he can slay!

				But by night, everywhere he's prancing!<br/>
				Look up on the pole! He's dancing!
				<br/>
				People everywhere fall for his charm,<br/>
				He definitely grew up on a stud farm,
